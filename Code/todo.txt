<DONE> Stop repeat traversals

<DONE> Fast Traverse (Make Mouse Subclass and flag for transition) : need to make the loop that allows for the pathfinder to get the path

<Done> Comment

Add the wait to WaitForSignal in main.cpp

Change getWalls in mouse.cpp to use sensor to detect walls around the robot

Change movement functions in mouse.cpp to move the robot around
    - Add in pid system
    - Allow for moving forward and turning

Optimize

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Small Changes:
    - Remove amt from turning functions as robot only needs to turn 90 degrees
